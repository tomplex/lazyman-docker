Dockerized [LazyMan](https://github.com/StevensNJD4/LazyMan).

Not fully working yet. See [issues](https://github.com/tomplex/lazyman-docker#issues)

## build

`./build.sh`

## run

`./start.sh`

## issues

I've tried both installing VLC in the container & passing through the user's VLC binary, but either way, no luck. LazyMan runs using the user's X server, but VLC fails on open.

## contributing

PR's welcome!
