# lazyman-docker

Not available on docker library, nor is this fully working.

## build

run `./build.sh`

## run

`./start.sh`

## issues

I've tried both installing VLC in the container & passing through the user's VLC binary, but either way, no luck. LazyMan runs using the user's X server, but VLC fails on open.
